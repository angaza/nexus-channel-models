      summary: Get current PAYG credit state
      description: |-
        This resource indicates the remaining PAYG (pay-as-you-go) credit of
        a specific device. Credit may be time-based or usage-based.

        'modes' are implemented similar to the description of `oic.r.mode`
        (https://www.oneiota.org/revisions/5310).

        Any device may be 'independent'.
        Controller-capable devices may be 'leading'.
        Accessory-capable devices may be 'following'.
        
        A "Following" device has PAYG credit managed by another device which is
        "Leading".

        "Relaying" is not implemented in this release. A "Relaying" device
        has PAYG credit managed by another device which is "Leading", but
        a third device follows the "Relaying" device ('chaining' the credit
        from device A to device C via device B, even though devices A and C
        are not directly connected).

        The default interface is 'oic.if.rw'. To retrieve the baseline OCF
        information, it is necessary to query with 'if=oic.if.baseline'.

        Application security constraints -
        When used with Nexus Channel, the device POSTing must be a controller
        with an active Nexus Channel Link to this device.
